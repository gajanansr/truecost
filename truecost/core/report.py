"""Turn A/B runs into a verdict, including the verdict of "no difference".

A benchmark that can only produce a headline number is a marketing tool. With
agent runs the variance between replicates of the *same* arm is large, so the
default answer to "did this help?" is usually "we cannot tell yet" -- and this
module is built to say so.

Comparisons are paired by (task, replicate): the arms ran back to back under
the same conditions, so the difference within a pair cancels most of the drift
that makes unpaired means useless at these sample sizes.
