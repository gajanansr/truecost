"""A/B runner: execute a task under Claude Code with the hook live vs inert.

Both arms run with identical settings, auth, model, and working directory.
The only difference is the arm's environment overlay, which makes the tool
under test pass through without rewriting anything. That keeps the comparison
honest -- no global settings mutation, and arms cannot interfere with each
other.

Cost comes from the transcript parser. The CLI's own `total_cost_usd` is
recorded alongside it as an independent check -- the two agree to six
decimals on real runs, which is what validates the billing model.

Two confounds this module controls for, both larger than any plausible
context-layer effect:

- Cache ordering. Whichever arm runs first pays cache-creation; the second
  reads a warm cache. Observed at 8x on a trivial task. Countered with a
  discarded warm-up run per task plus counterbalanced arm order.
- Give-up runs. An agent that quits early looks cheap. Every task carries a
  `verify` command; unverified runs are reported but excluded from cost
  comparisons.
